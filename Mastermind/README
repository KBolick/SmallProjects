This is a Mastermind game that uses a constraint solver to guess a secret code.
It can also be played with a human player.
There are a number of different pegs and a number of different colors that need
to be guessed in a number of turns in order to win. When a guess is made, the
guesser recieves a red point for each guessed peg with the right color and right
position, and a white point for each guessed peg with the right color and wrong
position.

This game requires the z3.rkt constraint solver to run.
